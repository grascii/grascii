"""A collection of useful information about the grascii grammar.

:var STROKES: A set of all valid strokes.
:var HARD_CHARACTERS: A set of all alphabetic characters that can appear as
    the first character in a stroke.
:var ANNOTATION_CHARACTERS: The set of all characters that are annotations.
:var ASPIRATE: The character corresponding to the aspirate.
:var MEDIUM_SOUND: The character corresponding to the medium sound of a standard
    vowel.
:var LONG_SOUND: The character corresponding to the long sound of a standard
    vowel.
:var LOOP: The character corresponding to the loop annotation.
:var REVERSE: The character corresponding to the reversing annotation.
:var WUNDERBAR: The character corresponding to the underbar (W) annotation.
:var ING: The character corresponding to the -ing ending.
:var LEFT: A character corresponding to a direction annotation.
:var RIGHT: A character corresponding to a direction annotation.
:var OBLIQUE: The character corresponding to the oblique annotation.
:var DISJOINER: The character corresponding to a disjoiner.
:var BOUNDARY: The character corresponding to a boundary.
:var INTERSECTION: The character corresponding to an intersection.
:var ALPHABET: The set of valid characters in the grascii language.
:var ANNOTATIONS: A dictionary of annotatable strokes to a sequence of
    acceptable annotations on the corresponding stroke. The sequece contains
    tuples of annotations. The tuples are ordered in the same order they
    must appear in a strict grascii string. The tuples contain mutually
    exclusive annotations. Ex: MEDIUM_SOUND and LONG_SOUND
